# Linked-list
## Aim
To construct a linked list that points to the address of the next element.
## Theory
A linked list is a sequence of data structures, which are connected together via links. It is a sequence of links which contains items. Each link contains a connection to another link. Linked list is the second most-used data structure after array. It consists of group of nodes in a sequence. Each node holds its own data and the address of the next node hence forming a chain like structure. Linked Lists are used to create trees and graphs. Linked lists are used to implement stacks, queues, graphs, etc. They also let you insert elements at the beginning and end of the list. We also use a function called malloc(). malloc() is a standard library function in C that allocates memory of size equal to the size of newnode structure in the heap region during runtime and returns a void pointer to that location.
## Algorithm
Step 1:Initialize a linked list. 
Step 2:Initialize 4 pointers inside main with the help of malloc(). 
Step 3:Point the info of the node to any given value for every variable. 
Step 4:Point the next of the node to the address of the next variable. For the last variable, point the value to NULL. 
Step 5:Print the present address and next address of each variable. 
Step 6:End. 
## Conclusion
In the practical, we learnt about the basic of Linked Lists and how to initialize it. We learnt how to use the malloc function to allocate memory with a specific size. We learnt how to point the values of info and next to the desired block and also print the address of every variable.
